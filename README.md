   It motivate me a lot! 

## Install Via Heroku

- First Star the Repo. 
- Fork and Rename the Repo. 
- Click Below to Start Deploying. 

<a href="https://heroku.com/deploy/" rel="nofollow" style="background-color: initial; box-sizing: border-box; color: #0366d6; text-decoration-line: none;"><img alt="Deploy" data-canonical-src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/83b0e95b38892b49184e07ad572c94c8038323fb/68747470733a2f2f7777772e6865726f6b7563646e2e636f6d2f6465706c6f792f627574746f6e2e737667" style="border-style: none; box-sizing: initial; max-width: 100%;" /></a></div>
</a>

## Install Locally

Simply clone the repository and run the main file:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AKHIL-SI/TheTufaanBot
cd userbot
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# <Create local_config.py with variables as given below>
python3 -m userbot
```

An example `local_config.py` file could be:

**Not All of the variables are mandatory**

__The Userbot should work by setting only the first two variables__

```python3
from heroku_config import Var

class Development(Var):
  APP_ID = 6
  API_HASH = "eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e"
```

**Heroku Configuration**
Simply just leave the Config as it is.

**Local Configuration**
Check [Line 111](https://github.com/Total-Noob-69/X-tra-Telegram/blob/master/userbot/uniborgConfig.py#L111) and start adding your vars there.
Fortunately there are no Mandatory vars for the UniBorg Support Config.

## Required Values

- `API ID and Hash` : This value is most important for setting up the Bot, get it from [Telegram Web Page](https://my.telegram.org/auth).
- `Bot Token and Username` : Get this for inline mode from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather). 
- `String Session` : String Sessions works as the code for your Telegram account. Generate your TufaanBot String Session from Repl. 
- `Logger ID` : Needed as a base. Make a Private Grp and add Rose bot, then type /id and copy the id in Deployment option.

## Repl (String Session) 

- First go to [REPLIT](https://replit.com/@akhilsi/TUFAANBOT#main.py).
- Click on run.
- After that it starts putting some variables.
- Now enter required values.
- U received code from telegram, copy that code and put it in required place.
- üëÄ Enabling two step verification is necessary, if u haven't enable, first make sure to set the two step verification.
- Enter your two step verification password.
- You have successfully generated your TufaanBot string. Check your saved message

## Note 

````
 I made this userbot as a learning curiousity üëÄ, TufaanBot is one of my favorite project.
 This userbot is written in Python and based on Telethon library.
 Also I have taken help for making some plugins from other userbot available in Telegram.
 Full respect to their respective owners... 
 If you found any bugs and problem or for any kind of support report in our support group. 

 Please note that If you are spamming groups, getting reported again and again, 
 and still if you are spamming... 
 and at the end Telegram banned your account. I will not be responsible for any kind of
 ban due to the bot... Note that!
````
## Warning

- Before Deployment, Pls make sure that you have enabled two step verification.
- Never Share your String Session, avoid sharing your String Session even someone is saying they are from Telegram. 
- Fork at your own risk, if you do any mistake that result into account ban then TufaanBot will not be responsible anymore. Watch tutorials if you are new.
- It's your concern if your account gets banned... If you keep spamming and spamming and got reported again and again.. And in last your account gets banned.
